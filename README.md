# MagicD3VIL's Radio Player
A fully responsive HTML5 online radio player using jQuery.

**The project features 2 main files:**
1. **index.html** – The fully responsive one page containing the radio player but also features like playback timer, song history, dark and light mode, and button to download the m3u file of the stream.
2. **playerOnly.html** – Contains only the radio player itself (good for embedding).

***Note:***
*This radio player uses a text file (not audio stream metadata) in order to display the currently playing song.*
